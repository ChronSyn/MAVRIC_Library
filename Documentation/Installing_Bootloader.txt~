Installing the DFU bootloader on AVR32 devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This document describes the necessary steps to flash a DFU bootloader onto the AVR32 (AT32UC3C1512C) used on the maveric autopilot. Note that all Atmel devices with USB support have the DFU bootloader already installed by default, however, a chip erase carried out with the JTAG will erase the bootloader, and it needs to be re-flashed if needed. To avoid removing the bootloader when using JTAG in Atmel Studio, go to Project Settings -> Tool, and change "Programming Settings" to "Erase only program area". 

################################
1) Flashing the bootloader image
################################

- Open Atmel Studio, go to Tools -> Device Programming. 
   - connect your board to the JTAG cable, and check if it has power
   - select JTAGICE3 tool (should be listed if connected properly), Device AT32UC3C1512C, Interface JTAG, and click Apply. 
   - to verify if the board is powered, click "Target Voltage". It should be above 3.0 V and not give and error. 
   - to verify if the chip is responding, click "Device signature". If any of the above steps fail, check all cables and connections and repeat.

- Go to Tab "Memories"
   - optional: Do a full chip erase
   - under "Flash", select the bootloader image file <...>/maveric/Code/Library/Bootloader/BOOTLOADER_AT32UC3C1512.hex
   - Program the flash
   - under "Userpage", select the bootloader userpage file <...>/maveric/Code/Library/Bootloader/USERPAGE_BOOT_SDA1.hex
   - Program the user page
- Go to Tab "Fuses"
   - verify that "Auto Read" is enabled, or "Read" fuses from the AVR
   - for BOOTPROT, select BOOTAREA_8KB


To flash the chip via the bootloader, one needs dfu-programmer (in Linux and windows). To find informations about DFU-programmer, read the related documentation.

2) Instructions for dfu-programmer
##################################

==================
LINUX instructions
==================

a) Install dfu-programmer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- download tar-ball from Sourceforge
- unzip somewhere, enter directory, follow build instructions: 

./configure --disable-libusb_1_0
make
sudo cp src/dfu-programmer /usr/local/bin

to get instructions:
dfu-programmer -h 


b) Allow standard users to access the board via usb:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-dfu_programmer.rules with the following content:
ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="*", GROUP="users", MODE="0660"
- Reboot


c) A typical flashing sequence:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 erase
dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 get 
dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 flash <flash-image.hex> --suppress-bootloader-mem 
dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 reset 

A script with this command sequence is useful to add to an IDE "Run" command, so that reflashing can be done by clicking a button or automatically after make. 


====================
WINDOWS instructions
====================

a) Install dfu-programmer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- unzip somewhere dfu-programmer-win-0.6.2.zip found in DFU-programmer folder


b) Install driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- connect the usb cable to a maveric board WITH THE BOOTLOADER FLASHED
- install the driver: (DO NOT let windows search for the driver) Specify the path to the .inf file found in the folder dfu-prog-usb-1.2.2


c) A typical flashing sequence:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 erase
dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 get 
dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 flash <flash-image.hex> --suppress-bootloader-mem 
dfu-programmer at32uc3c1512 reset 

The script dfu-programming.bat with this command sequence is include in DFU-programmer folder. This script flashes your last compiled .hex to your maveric board (by default the file <YourProject>/Debug/megafly.hex)

- move this file in your project directory (ex. Maveric_myCopter)
- execute this script whenever you want to flash your code (the .hex file by default is Debug/megafly.hex)




d) Known issues:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on configuration, the bootloader usually comes up at power-up, which means the application doesn't start automatically. A reset (hardware or software via dfu) will start the application.
Getting the bootloader to start again is sometimes tricky, as it won't always launch at power-up. It's possible that it checks an input pin which might still have charge. Waiting a few seconds before plugging in usually works. It probably would make sense to invert the behaviour: the application starts at normal power-up, pressing the reset button will launch the bootloader. Another option would be to integrate the bootloader into the application, so that a software reset into boot-mode can be issued through USB.
